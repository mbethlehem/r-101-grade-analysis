## Question 1

```{r}
#| message: false
grades <- vroom(here("grades.csv"))
```

## Question 2
```{r}
library(knitr)
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(grades |> summary("min"=min(Exam), "max"= max(Exam), "median"= median(Exam), "mean"= mean(Exam)))
```
```{r}
grades |> summarise("min"=min(Exam, na.rm=TRUE), "max"= max(Exam, na.rm=TRUE), "median"= median(Exam, na.rm=TRUE), "mean"= mean(Exam, na.rm=TRUE)) |> knitr::kable()
```
## Question 3

```{r}
num_absent <- grades |> filter(is.na(Exam))
```

There were  `r nrow(num_absent)` absent students. 

## Question 4
Represent graphically in an adapted way the distribution of grades at the Exam. Make sure to adapt the code to avoid any error or warning from ggplot2.

```{r}
grades_new <- grades |> filter(!is.na(Exam))
```
```{r}
ggplot(grades_new, aes(x=Exam)) + geom_boxplot()
```
## Question 5

Compute the number of students in each Group and include the results in your document as a table

```{r}
grades |> group_by(Group) |> summarise(N=n()) |> knitr::kable()
```
## Question 6

Represent the same information as in the previous question in a graphical way
```{r}
count_group <- grades |> group_by(Group) |> summarise(N=n())
```

```{r}
ggplot(count_group, aes(x=Group, y=N)) + geom_col()
```
